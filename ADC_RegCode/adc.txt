A/D conversion of the various channels can be performed in single, continuous,
scan or discontinuous mode.

ADC conversion time:
– STM32F103xx performance line devices: 1 µs at 56 MHz (1.17 µs at 72 MHz)

groups:

adc->smpr2->sample time
adc->sqrx ->channel selection,conversion length


algorithms-pseudo code :

In continuous conversion mode ADC starts another conversion as soon as it finishes one.
This mode is started either by external trigger or by setting the ADON bit in the ADC_CR2
register, while the CONT bit is 1.
After each conversion:
• If a regular channel was converted:
– The converted data is stored in the 16-bit ADC_DR register
– The EOC (End Of Conversion) flag is set
– An interrupt is generated if the EOCIE is set.

• If an injected channel was converted:
– The converted data is stored in the 16-bit ADC_DRJ1 register
– The JEOC (End Of Conversion Injected) flag is set
– An interrupt is generated if the JEOCIE bit is set.



Channel-by-channel programmable sample time:

ADC samples the input voltage for a number of ADC_CLK cycles which can be modified using the SMP[2:0] bits in the ADC_SMPR1 and ADC_SMPR2 registers. Each channel can be
sampled with a different sample time.
The total conversion time is calculated as follows:
Tconv = Sampling time + 12.5 cycles
Example:
With an ADCCLK = 14 MHz and a sampling time of 1.5 cycles:
Tconv = 1.5 + 12.5 = 14 cycles = 1 µs



Reading the temperature:

To use the sensor:
1. Select the ADCx_IN16 input channel.
2. Select a sample time of 17.1 µs
3. Set the TSVREFE bit in the ADC control register 2 (ADC_CR2) to wake up the
temperature sensor from power down mode.
4. Start the ADC conversion by setting the ADON bit (or by external trigger).
5. Read the resulting VSENSE data in the ADC data register
6. Obtain the temperature using the following formula:
Temperature (in °C) = {(V25 - VSENSE) / Avg_Slope} + 25.
Where,
V25 = VSENSE value for 25° C and
Avg_Slope = Average Slope for curve between Temperature vs. VSENSE (given in
mV/° C or µV/ °C).
Refer to the Electrical characteristics section for the actual values of V25 and
Avg_Slope.
Note: The sensor has a startup time after waking from power down mode before it can output
VSENSE at the correct level. The ADC also has a startup time after power-on, so to minimize
the delay, the ADON and TSVREFE bits should be set at the same time.

Flash 

For write and erase operations on the Flash memory (write/erase), the internal RC oscillator
(HSI) must be ON.

● FPEC key register (FLASH_KEYR)
● Option byte key register (FLASH_OPTKEYR)
● Flash control register (FLASH_CR)
● Flash status register (FLASH_SR)
● Flash address register (FLASH_AR)
● Option byte register (FLASH_OBR)
● Write protection register (FLASH_WRPR)

● RDPRT key = 0x00A5
● KEY1 = 0x45670123
● KEY2 = 0xCDEF89AB

The main Flash memory programming sequence in standard mode is as follows:

● Check that no main Flash memory operation is ongoing by checking the BSY bit in the
FLASH_SR register.
● Set the PG bit in the FLASH_CR register.
● Perform the data write (half-word) at the desired address.
● Wait for the BSY bit to be reset.
● Read the programmed value and verify.


Erase:

● Check that no Flash memory operation is ongoing by checking the BSY bit in the
FLASH_CR register
● Set the PER bit in the FLASH_CR register
● Program the FLASH_AR register to select a page to erase
● Set the STRT bit in the FLASH_CR register
● Wait for the BSY bit to be reset
● Read the erased page and verify
